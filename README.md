# Time-Calculator
A basic tool written in C++ to perform basic calculations involving time durations.



## Installation
Simply use the `make` command in the repo's directory to compile the code and then run the executable with the command `./time_calculator`.

## Usage
```
./time_calculator <algorithm> <time_1> <time_2>

    <algorithm> must be either "--add" or "--subtract"
    <time_1> and <time_2> must be formatted as <hr>:<min>:<sec>
```

## Features (Current & Planned)
- [x] Take two different time durations as input, perform either addition or subtraction, spit out the results
- [ ] Change the input parameters to accept as many time duration inputs that the user wishes to provide (aka dynamic input parameters)
- [ ] Accept time parameters contained within an input file
